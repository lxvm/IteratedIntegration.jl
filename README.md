This package provides experimental algorithms for globally h-adaptive iterated
integration.

The main takeaways of these experiments are that:
- pole-subtraction is superior to quadgk for integration of meromorphic functions
- The peak missing problem, which occurs for near singular functions, can be
  elegantly solved with auxiliary integrands
- nested integrals can be implemented reliably when absolute tolerances for
  inner integrals are scaled by the measure of the outer integration domains
- nested integrals cannot be reliably replaced by globally-adaptive schemes using
  a treap (tree-heap) and any adaptation scheme other than depth-first

## Algorithm

See the `notes` folder for a description of the IAI algorithm.
The implementation is based on [QuadGK.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/QuadGK.jl)
